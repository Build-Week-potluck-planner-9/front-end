The Purpose of this Potluck Planner is to help make it easy to bring the ones you care about together for a well organized feast. Without this planner it can get pretty complicated to figure out who is bringing what, but with our Planner you can easily know what you are responsible for and who/what to expect when you get there.

1. As an `organizer` I can create an upcoming `potluck` and invite my friends to attend

2. As an `organizer` I can adjust `date`s, `time`s and `location`s of the potluck

3. As an `organizer` I can use the list feature in my app to add food `items` that we'd like to see at the potluck

4. As a `guest` to a potluck I want to be able to confirm that I'm going to the upcoming `event`

5. As a `guest` I'd like to be able to select which `item`s I'd like to be responsible for bringing
