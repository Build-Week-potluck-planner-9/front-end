## CLONE this repo. *** DO NOT FORK ***

### DIRECTIONS: 
  1. cd into front-end, then cd into buildweek-potluck and run npm i to install dependencies, after it has installed, npm start to bring up the project in the       browser.
  2. Open a new terminal and cd into front-end ONLY and "git checkout -b <your-branch>" 
  3. MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE PUSHING TO YOUR BRANCH ONLY AND NOT TO MAIN. ALL PUSHES MUST BE MADE INSIDE THE front-end folder, not the buildweek-potluck folder.
